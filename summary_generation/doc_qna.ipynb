      "3. Comparing two groups of samples with different standard deviations. For example, we have a sample of 50 people who exercise for 30 minutes per day and another sample of 50 people who exercise for 60 minutes per day. We want to know if the difference in exercise time affects their preferences.\n",
      "4. Comparing two groups of samples with different medians. For example, we have a sample of 100 people who prefer beef and another sample of 100 people who prefer chicken. We want to know if the difference in preference is due to chance or not.\n",

      "In all these examples, T-Test can be used to determine whether there are any significant differences between the two groups being compared. The key point to keep in mind while using T-Test is that the samples must be independent and identically distributed. This means that each sample should be independent of the other and should have the same distribution as the data we are trying to analyze.\n",

      "Example 1: A pharmaceutical company claims that its new drug lowers blood pressure by an average of 15 mmHg. Using a sample of 20 patients, test the claim at a 0.05 level of significance.\n",
      "Solution: We have H0 = μ = 15 mmHg and Ha = μ > 15 mmHg. From the formula for T-Test, we get:\n",
      "t = (sum of squares of deviations - (k + (z^2/n)) / (n - 1)\n",
      "where k is the sample size, n is the population size, and z is the standard deviation of the sample.\n",
      "In this case, n = 20, Z = 3 mmHg (from the formula for standard deviation), and k = 20. Substituting these values, we get:\n",

      "= 20 x 0 + 40 / 19 = 20.67\n",
      "Since the calculated value of t is greater than the critical value of t at a 0.05 level of significance, we reject H0 and accept Ha. Therefore, the claim that the new drug lowers blood pressure by an average of 15 mmHg is accepted.\n",
      "Example 2: A researcher wants to determine whether the mean age of a sample of 40 subjects is different from 30 years. Using a T-Test, test the claim at a 0.05 level of significance.\n",
      "Solution: We have H0 = μ = 30 years and Ha = μ ≠ 30 years. From the formula for T-Test, we get:\n",
